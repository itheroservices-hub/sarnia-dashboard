# Canadian Copyright Compliance Audit - Local News Module

## Critical Copyright Violations Identified

### ❌ **HIGH RISK: Direct Copyright Infringement**

#### 1. **Verbatim Summary Reproduction**
**Issue**: Many summaries are direct copies of original article content
**Examples**:
- "Investigators are being tight-lipped about their probe into Thursday's fatal fire in Sarnia's south end."
- "A Sarnia judge told David Grego it's pretty obvious what was going on."
- "Walking up the beach, pieces of ice hanging from her hair and bathing suit, Triniti Boucher said she couldn't feel anything."

**Risk Level**: HIGH - This constitutes unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted material

#### 2. **Extended Title Truncation Still Contains Copyrighted Material**
**Issue**: Even truncated titles contain copyrighted phrases and specific details
**Examples**:
- "Sarnia-area man sues complainant for $3.5M after charges dropped A Sarnia-Lambton man who had assault and sexual assault charges against him dropped is suing the complainant in the case for $3.5 million..."

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Exceeds fair dealing for headlines

#### 3. **Direct Quotes from Articles**
**Issue**: Summaries contain direct quotes from copyrighted articles
**Example**: "Triniti Boucher said she couldn't feel anything."

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Requires permission for direct quotation

#### 4. **Specific Factual Details Beyond Headlines**
**Issue**: Summaries include specific details that are copyrighted expression
**Examples**:
- Exact monetary amounts ($3.5 million)
- Specific dates and times
- Detailed descriptions of events

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH - May exceed fair dealing
